# Credit-Card-Risk-Modeling

The main objective will be using machine learning models for predicting loan grades and credit default.
Raw dataset is from Lending Club,which was one of the first companies to create an online marketplace for P2P Lending back in 2006.
Loan Grades and Subgrades are assigned by Lending Club based on the borrowerâ€™s credit worthiness and also on some variables specific to that Loan.
